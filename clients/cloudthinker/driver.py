"""
CloudThinker agent driver.

Drives the two-phase benchmark flow (diagnosis + mitigation) against a locally
running CloudThinker stack, then submits results to the evaluation conductor.

Anna runs as a hosted multi-agent system, not a subprocess the harness owns, so
this driver uses `container_isolation: false` and talks to the stack through the
`ct` dev CLI (`ct chat --json`), which mints the JWT and streams the turn.

The evaluation MCP tools (kubectl / prometheus / loki / jaeger) are registered as
workspace MCP connections in CloudThinker, so Anna reaches the benchmark cluster
the same way a customer reaches their own -- no harness-side tool shim.

    Distinct from `run_turn_retrying`, which recovers by starting a FRESH
    conversation. That is exactly wrong here: the mitigation turn only works
    because it continues the diagnosis conversation, so a retry that abandons it
    would silently turn the stage into a cold turn with none of the investigation
    in context.

    What we are waiting out is the same active-stream guard the approval loop in
    `run_turn` already backs off from --

        POST /autonomous-agents/chat/stream?conversation_id=...
        400 "Conversation is already streaming. Please reload the page to reconnect."

    -- so this reuses that loop's budget rather than inventing a second policy.
    The gap was only that the guard was handled for gate resumes and not for the
    turn that opens the mitigation stage.

    `ct` prints nothing to stdout on that rejection, so it surfaces as `ct_no_json`
    in about 60ms with the guard's detail on stderr. Two very different failures
    share that one error string, and giving them one policy is what kept breaking
    this: the guard means "the previous turn is STILL RUNNING, keep waiting", while
    anything else means "this attempt is dead, retry a bounded number of times".
    Waiting out a dead attempt wastes the stage; giving up on a live one throws
    away work the agent is in the middle of doing. Both happened.

    Cancelling the in-flight stream instead of waiting is tempting and wrong. On
    2026-07-31 the stream this loop was blocked on turned out to be the mitigation
    itself: it ran 787s, executed 27 further tools, and the oracle scored it

# CT_PROMPT_MODE selects a *pair* of prompts, diagnosis and mitigation, not just
# the diagnosis one. A mode is the unit a published number is labelled with, so
# changing either half of a shipped mode would silently invalidate results already
# recorded under that label. Older modes are therefore frozen, never edited.
#
# `guided` is the original. It was written before we read the judge rubric and
# independently reproduced it: "the actual mutated value: the selector, env var,
# image tag, port, ... resource limit" is D2-Q2 almost verbatim, and "distinguish
# the resource that caused the failure from resources that merely show symptoms"
# is D1-Q2. Scores under it measure Anna with the answer key in hand, so they are
# not comparable to any published baseline. Frozen: it reproduces the 2026-07-27
# pilot.
#
# `neutral` matches the harness's own Claude Code driver
# (clients/claudecode/driver.py:149-189), written by the SREGym authors:
# investigate, then submit prose describing the issue, graded on whether the
# faulty components and root cause are right. No enumeration of which fields might
# be mutated, no origin-versus-symptom hint. The only deliberate divergence is
# naming our MCP connections, which is plumbing, not guidance. Frozen: it
# reproduces the 2026-07-28 cold n=3.
#
# `scoped` is the default, and is `neutral` plus exactly two additions. Both were
# decided deliberately on 2026-07-28 (runbook §3.3, §3.4); they are not neutrality
# fixes and must not be read as such.
#
#   1. Diagnosis names SREGym's own telemetry plumbing as out of scope. The
#      observer rewrites `jaeger*` into ExternalName aliases for `otel-collector`
#      in every namespace of all 116 problems and orphans a jaeger pod, so a
#      service-with-no-matching-pods exists regardless of the injected fault --
#      the same shape as several real faults. This is a divergence from the
#      upstream baseline, which gets no such warning: it removes a distractor
#      SREGym never intended to inject, at the cost of no longer measuring whether
#      an agent can tell harness scaffolding from the application. It says nothing
#      about where the fault is or how to look for it, and deliberately does NOT
#      say "check the app's entry-point service first" -- anchoring on the first
#      dramatic signal instead of the front door is Anna's real weakness and stays
#      measured.
#
#   2. Mitigation states the grading criterion. Upstream already tells its agent
#      "Your fix is also evaluated on whether it addresses the root cause, not
#      just the symptoms"; ours stated no criterion at all, so this closes a gap
#      rather than opening one. It is what the §3.4 revert-versus-workaround
#      question reduces to once the upstream wording is the reference.
#
# Every mode keeps the autonomy instruction. Upstream has the same ("DO NOT ask
# for user confirmation"), and without it our HITL gate deadlocks the run instead
# of measuring anything.
